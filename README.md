**Natural Language Processing Methods Comparison**

**Introduction:**

This repository contains implementations of four different methods for Natural Language Processing (NLP): TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Each method is utilized for a specific NLP task, and their performances are compared using precision, recall, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.

**Methods:**

1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
   - **Implementation:** Utilized the TF-IDF algorithm to convert text documents into numerical vectors, where each dimension represents the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents.
   - **Task:** Applied TF-IDF for tasks like text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis.
   
2. **Word2Vec:**
   - **Implementation:** Employed the Word2Vec algorithm to learn distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.
   - **Task:** Used Word2Vec for tasks such as word similarity, word analogy, and text generation.
   
3. **Doc2Vec:**
   - **Implementation:** Implemented the Doc2Vec algorithm, an extension of Word2Vec, to learn fixed-length representations of entire documents.
   - **Task:** Employed Doc2Vec for tasks including document similarity, document clustering, and text classification.
   
4. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
   - **Implementation:** Developed a Recurrent Neural Network architecture, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), for sequence modeling and processing of textual data.
   - **Task:** Utilized RNN for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling.

**Performance Comparison:**

The performance of each method was evaluated using standard NLP evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and possibly others depending on the specific task. The evaluation was conducted on benchmark datasets relevant to each task, ensuring a fair comparison.

**Conclusion:**

This repository provides implementations of four diverse NLP methods and their comparative evaluation. Developers and researchers can refer to this repository to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method for various NLP tasks, helping them choose the most suitable approach based on the specific requirements of their project or research.
